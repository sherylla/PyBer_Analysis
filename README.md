### Write a summary on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.

Fare for each city type is faily consistent, with no big dips or increase. Urban, though started the year just above $1,500, has picked up and is consistently between $2,000 to $2,5000 range. 

Suburban also started off lower at $721, but towards the end of April, the sum of weekly fares almost doubled. On the other hand, rural data shows that in the span of 4 months, there's not a lot of difference from when it started off in January.
